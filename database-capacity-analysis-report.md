# Database Capacity Analysis Report
## Bay View Association PostgreSQL Database on DigitalOcean

**Analysis Date**: 2025-07-18  
**Database**: defaultdb  
**PostgreSQL Version**: 16.9 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu  

## Executive Summary

The Bay View Association database is currently using **9.2 MB** of storage on DigitalOcean's managed PostgreSQL service. The database is in excellent health with a 100% cache hit ratio and minimal data (only 3 memorial records). The system is well-designed but significantly underutilized, with most tables empty.

## Key Findings

### 1. Database Size and Capacity
- **Total Database Size**: 9.2 MB (9,449,955 bytes)
- **Number of Schemas**: 2 (`bayview` and `crouse_chapel`)
- **Total Tables**: 19 tables
- **Total Row Count**: Only 3 rows (all in `bayview.memorials`)

### 2. Storage Distribution
- **crouse_chapel schema**: 448 KB (15 tables, all empty)
- **bayview schema**: 160 KB (4 tables, 3 memorial records)

### 3. Performance Metrics
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: 100% (Excellent)
- **Total Transactions**: 53,993 committed, 10,751 rolled back
- **Connection Utilization**: 2 of 25 connections (8% usage)
- **No table bloat detected** (all tables under 20% bloat threshold)

### 4. Index Analysis
- **Total Indexes**: 48 indexes across all tables
- **Unused Indexes**: 10 indexes have never been scanned
- **Index/Table Size Ratio**: High ratios (200-1000%) due to empty tables
- **Recommendation**: Most indexes are unused because tables have no data

### 5. Database Configuration
- **Max Connections**: 25 (sufficient for current load)
- **Shared Buffers**: 190 MB
- **Effective Cache Size**: 574 MB
- **Work Memory**: 2 MB per operation
- **Autovacuum**: Enabled with 3 workers

## Detailed Table Analysis

### Largest Tables by Size
1. `crouse_chapel.service_applications`: 96 KB (0 rows)
2. `bayview.memorials`: 64 KB (3 rows) ⭐ Only table with data
3. `crouse_chapel.baptism_details`: 48 KB (0 rows)
4. `crouse_chapel.clergy`: 40 KB (0 rows)

### Schema Structure
**bayview schema** (Memorial Garden):
- `memorials` - 3 records
- `attachments` - 0 records
- `audit_log` - 0 records
- `memorial_payments` - 0 records

**crouse_chapel schema** (Chapel Services):
- 15 tables for service management
- All tables currently empty
- Well-structured with foreign key relationships

## Capacity Planning Recommendations

### 1. Current Capacity Status
- **Storage**: Using less than 0.1% of typical database capacity
- **Connections**: Using 8% of available connections
- **Performance**: Excellent with 100% cache hit ratio

### 2. Growth Projections
Based on the current schema and expected usage:
- **Memorial Garden**: ~100-500 records/year = ~1-5 MB/year
- **Chapel Services**: ~200-1000 services/year = ~5-20 MB/year
- **Total Growth**: ~10-30 MB/year

### 3. Scaling Considerations
- Current DigitalOcean plan can easily handle 1000x current data volume
- No immediate scaling needs
- Database could handle 10+ years of growth without issues

### 4. Optimization Opportunities
1. **Remove Unused Indexes**: 10 indexes have never been used
2. **Consider Archiving Strategy**: For records older than 5 years
3. **Monitor Sequential Scans**: As data grows, watch for missing indexes

### 5. Backup and Recovery
- Ensure regular backups are configured (DigitalOcean automated backups)
- Test restore procedures quarterly
- Consider point-in-time recovery settings

## Security and Maintenance

### Current Security
- SSL/TLS enforced connections
- User: `doadmin` (managed by DigitalOcean)
- Database isolated in managed environment

### Maintenance Status
- Autovacuum: Active and properly configured
- No table bloat detected
- Statistics up to date

## Conclusion

The Bay View Association database is exceptionally well-designed and currently operating at minimal capacity. The PostgreSQL 16.9 installation on DigitalOcean provides excellent performance with significant room for growth. The database could easily handle 10-20 years of data growth without requiring any infrastructure changes.

### Key Recommendations
1. **No immediate action required** - Database is healthy
2. **Monitor as data grows** - Set up alerts for >80% capacity
3. **Clean up unused indexes** - Minor optimization opportunity
4. **Document backup procedures** - Ensure recovery processes are tested
5. **Plan for archival** - Consider long-term data retention policies

The current infrastructure is more than adequate for the organization's needs and provides excellent value with managed PostgreSQL benefits including automated backups, monitoring, and maintenance.
