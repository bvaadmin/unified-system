- Candidate name, parents, witnesses, baptism type
- Proper select field mapping for baptism types

**General Use Fields**: ✅ Complete
- Event details, organization, setup/cleanup times
- Fee calculation and tracking

**Shared Fields**: ✅ Complete
- Contact information, clergy, music, equipment
- Individual equipment checkboxes in Notion
- Performance location as select field
- Policy acknowledgments tracked

#### Memorial Garden Pipeline
```
HTML Form → API Processing → PostgreSQL Storage → Notion Sync
```

- Dual ID tracking (PostgreSQL ↔ Notion)
- Payment and policy tracking

### 5. Enhanced Features

#### Audit Trail System ✅
- Automatic tracking of all database changes
- Before/after values stored as JSONB
- User attribution ready for implementation

- `DATABASE_URL` / `DATABASE_URL_CLEAN` ✅
- `NOTION_API_KEY` ✅
- `CHAPEL_NOTION_DB_ID` ✅
- `MEMORIAL_NOTION_DB_ID` ✅
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` ✅

### 8. Validation Tools

New tools added for system maintenance:
- `npm run validate` - Comprehensive configuration validation
- `npm run add-enhanced-tables` - Add audit, payment, and attachment tables
- Database-specific initialization scripts for each component

## Recommendations

### Completed ✅
1. All PostgreSQL tables properly structured
2. Notion databases have all required fields
