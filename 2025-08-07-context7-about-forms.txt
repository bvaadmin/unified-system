 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results

> see what you can learn via context7 about forms and typeform-like smoothe flow from question 
  to question

● I'll search for information about forms and smooth typeform-like question flows using
  Context7.

● context7 - resolve-library-id (MCP)(libraryName: "typeform")
  ⎿  Available Libraries (top matches):

     Each result includes:
     … +381 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me get the Typeform documentation to learn about their smooth question flow:

● context7 - get-library-docs (MCP)(context7CompatibleLibraryID:
                                   "/context7/typeform-developers", topic: "smooth flow question
                                    transitions user experience", tokens: 15000)

● Let me also search for information about smooth form transitions and user experience patterns:

● context7 - resolve-library-id (MCP)(libraryName: "react hook form")
  ⎿  Available Libraries (top matches):

     Each result includes:
     … +374 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● context7 - get-library-docs (MCP)(context7CompatibleLibraryID:
                                   "/react-hook-form/documentation", topic: "multi-step forms
                                   wizard smooth transitions progressive disclosure", tokens:
                                   10000)

● Based on my research with Context7, here's what I learned about forms and smooth Typeform-like
   question-to-question flows:

  Key Concepts for Smooth Form Flows

  Typeform's Approach:

  - Conversational UI: Questions appear one at a time with typing emulation
  - Progressive disclosure: Only showing the current question reduces cognitive load
  - Smooth transitions: Using callbacks like onQuestionChanged to track navigation
  - Logic jumps: Conditional branching based on answers for personalized flows
  - Recall information: Using previous answers in subsequent questions (e.g., "Earlier, you
  rated our service as {{field:rating_reference}}")

  React Hook Form Multi-Step/Wizard Pattern:

  - State management: Using libraries like little-state-machine or Redux to persist data across
  steps
  - Progressive enhancement: Supporting both client and server-side rendering
  - Step navigation: Using React Router or similar for step transitions
  - Form context: Sharing form methods across components with FormProvider

  Implementation Strategies:

  1. Single Question Focus
    - Display one question at a time
    - Animate transitions between questions
    - Use keyboard navigation (Enter to proceed, Tab for options)
  2. Progress Indicators
    - Show progress as percentage or step count
    - Visual feedback for completed sections
    - Allow backward navigation while preserving answers
  3. Conditional Logic
    - Skip irrelevant questions based on previous answers
    - Dynamic question text using template variables
    - Branch to different paths based on user responses
  4. Smooth Animations
    - Slide transitions between questions
    - Fade in/out effects
    - Auto-focus on new inputs
    - Libraries like auto-animate for zero-config transitions
  5. User Experience Enhancements
    - Auto-save progress
    - Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
    - Mobile-optimized touch interactions
    - Accessibility with ARIA attributes

  The key to Typeform-like flows is combining progressive disclosure with smooth animations,
  conditional logic, and a conversational feel that makes forms feel less overwhelming and more
  engaging.
