            <h2>About the Chapel</h2>
            <p>The Crouse Memorial Chapel was dedicated in 1993 for the enhancement and promotion of the religious heritage and life in Bay View. During the season, the Chapel is open daily for meditation and prayer. Communion is served each Sunday at 8:45 a.m.</p>
            
            <p>The Chapel seats 80 comfortably. The use of the Chapel for baptisms, weddings and memorial services is for Bay View members and their extended family, faculty and staff. Bay View members have priority.</p>
            
            <p>A member of the Altar Guild shall be present for all scheduled religious services. Services held outside of the eight-week Bay View summer season will be at the discretion of the Director of Worship and Religious Life. They will not be the responsibility of the Altar Guild.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Procedures</h2>

                <li>After acceptance of the event, and the date(s)/rehearsal(s) are secured, fees must be paid at the Russell Hall Office. <strong>Only then is the date guaranteed.</strong> The request for dates will be scheduled in the date-order in which they were approved and fees were paid. These Special Events will be limited to just one per day. The Wade Administration Office will send information to the Altar Guild.</li>
