## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Data Migration Errors**
   - Mitigation: Test migrations 3x, keep legacy system running

2. **Payment Processing Issues**
   - Mitigation: Manual backup process, dual-run first week

3. **User Adoption Resistance**
   - Mitigation: Staff do entry for members initially

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Performance Under Load**
   - Mitigation: Load test with 2x expected traffic

2. **Integration Delays**
   - Mitigation: Core features work standalone
