# Bay View Production Monitoring System Setup

**Task Complete**: T-S2025-07-005 - Set up monitoring and alerts for production

## 🎯 Monitoring System Overview

The Bay View Association production monitoring system provides comprehensive observability for the August 2025 launch, covering all critical systems including Chapel services, Memorial Garden applications, Finance APIs, and the PostgreSQL database.

## 📊 Monitoring Components Activated

### 1. Core Monitoring Infrastructure
- **Prometheus-compatible metrics** at `/api/monitoring/metrics`
- **Health check system** with database, memory, and connection pool monitoring  
- **Structured logging** with component-specific context
- **Real-time alerting** with severity-based escalation
- **Interactive dashboard** at `/monitoring/dashboard.html`

### 2. Bay View-Specific Metrics
- **Chapel service submissions** and availability tracking
- **Memorial garden applications** with Notion sync status
- **Member and cottage data** operational metrics
- **Payment transaction** monitoring and revenue tracking
- **Event registration** capacity and deadline alerts

### 3. System Health Monitoring
- **Database performance** - Response times, connection usage, slow queries
- **Memory usage** - Heap consumption with thresholds (warning: 80%, critical: 90%)
- **Connection pool** - Active/idle connections, waiting requests
- **API response times** - Per-endpoint performance tracking
- **Error rates** - Automatic alerting on 5xx errors

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **Monitoring endpoints enabled** - Moved from `/api/monitoring-disabled/` to `/api/monitoring/`
2. **Vercel routing configured** - Added `/api/monitoring/*` routes
3. **Dashboard deployed** - Full-featured monitoring interface
4. **Alert system active** - Multi-level severity with auto-resolution
5. **Health checks operational** - 30-second intervals with timeout protection

### 📋 Monitoring Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `/api/monitoring/status` | System status and health checks | ✅ Active |
| `/api/monitoring/metrics` | Prometheus-compatible metrics | ✅ Active |
| `/api/monitoring/init` | Initialize monitoring system | ✅ Active |
| `/monitoring/dashboard.html` | Interactive monitoring dashboard | ✅ Active |

## 🔧 Configuration & Thresholds

### Alert Thresholds
- **Database Response Time**: Warning 1s, Critical 5s
- **API Response Time**: Warning 3s, Critical 10s (Vercel limit)
- **Memory Usage**: Warning 80%, Critical 90%
- **Connection Pool**: Warning 70%, Critical 85%
- **Error Rate**: Warning 5%, Critical 10%

### Bay View Operational Limits
- **Chapel bookings**: Max 3 per day
- **Memorial submissions**: Max 10 per hour (anti-spam)
- **Large transactions**: Alert on >$5,000
- **Daily revenue**: Alert if >$100,000
- **Event capacity**: Alert at 90% full

## 📈 Monitoring Dashboard Features

### Real-Time Metrics
- **System Overview**: Environment, version, uptime, memory usage
- **Health Checks**: Database, memory, connection pool status
- **Active Alerts**: Severity-based alert management
- **Database Metrics**: Size, connections, slow queries
- **Bay View Operations**: Members, events, payments, submissions

### Auto-Refresh
- **30-second refresh** interval for real-time monitoring
- **Manual refresh** capability
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile viewing

## 🏛️ Bay View Heritage Integration

The monitoring system preserves Bay View's 150-year heritage while enabling modern operations:

- **Authentic terminology**: Cottage "leaseholders" not "owners"
- **Member-centric design**: All metrics consider member vs. non-member status
- **Seasonal patterns**: Event and payment tracking aligned with summer programs
- **Community focus**: Chapel and Memorial services prioritized as core functions

## 🔍 Testing & Validation

### System Tests Completed
1. **Initialization test** - Monitoring system startup ✅
2. **Memory tracking** - Heap usage monitoring ✅  
3. **Alert generation** - Database connection alerts ✅
4. **Logging system** - Structured JSON output ✅
5. **Dashboard rendering** - Full interface functionality ✅

### Production Readiness
- **Environment variables** configured via Vercel
- **CORS policies** enabled for monitoring endpoints
- **Error handling** with fallback responses
- **Performance optimized** with connection pooling
- **Security reviewed** with safe alert information exposure

## 📚 Integration with Bay View Systems

### Existing API Endpoints
The monitoring system integrates with all existing Bay View APIs:
- **Chapel APIs** (`/api/chapel/*`) - Service scheduling and availability
- **Memorial APIs** (`/api/memorial/*`) - Garden applications and Notion sync
- **Admin APIs** (`/api/admin/*`) - Database operations and imports
- **Configuration APIs** (`/api/config/*`) - Runtime settings management

### Database Integration
- **Connection pool monitoring** via `lib/db-pool.js`
- **Query performance tracking** with pg_stat_statements
- **Schema-aware metrics** for bayview, crouse_chapel, core schemas
- **Transaction monitoring** for dual-write operations

## 🚨 Alert Management

### Alert Levels
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: System down, immediate action required
- **⚠️ HIGH**: Feature blocked, action required soon  
- **⚡ MEDIUM**: Performance degraded, investigate
- **ℹ️ LOW**: Informational, no immediate action
- **📝 INFO**: System status updates

### Alert Routing (Future Enhancement)
- **Slack integration** ready (webhook URL configuration)
- **PagerDuty support** available (API key setup)
- **Email alerts** configured (SMTP settings)
- **Auto-resolution** for low-severity alerts (1 hour)

## 🎉 August 2025 Launch Ready

The Bay View monitoring system is **production-ready** for the August 2025 launch with:

- **Comprehensive coverage** of all system components
- **Proactive alerting** to prevent service disruptions
- **Bay View-specific metrics** for community operations
- **Scalable architecture** supporting 2,000+ families
- **Heritage-preserving design** honoring Chautauqua traditions
